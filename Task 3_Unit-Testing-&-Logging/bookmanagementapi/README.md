# 📥 Sample Request Body

```json
{
  "isbn": "9780134685991",
  "title": "Effective Java",
  "author": "Joshua Bloch",
  "pages": 416
}
```

# 🧪 Unit Testing

The service layer is tested using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**.

### Test Class

```
BookServiceTest.java
```

### Test Cases Covered

* Create Book
* Get All Books
* Get Book By ID
* Update Book
* Delete Book
* Book Not Found Exception

---

# 📊 Code Coverage

JaCoCo is used to generate the code coverage report.

### Coverage Summary

* Overall Project Coverage: **65%**
* Service Layer Coverage: **92%**

Coverage reports are generated automatically under:

```
target/site/jacoco/index.html
```
